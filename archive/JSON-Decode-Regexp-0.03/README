NAME
    JSON::Decode::Regexp - JSON parser as a single Perl Regex

SYNOPSIS
     use JSON::Decode::Regexp qw(from_json);
     my $data = from_json(q([1, true, "a", {"b":null}]));

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a packaging of Randal L. Schwartz' code (with minor
    modification) originally posted at:

     http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=995856

    The code is licensed "just like Perl".

FUNCTIONS
  from_json($str) => DATA
    Decode JSON in $str. Dies on error.

FAQ
  How does this module compare to other JSON modules on CPAN?
    This module is rather slower than JSON::PP, does not support Unicode,
    and does not pinpoint exact location on parse error. But it is a cool
    hack and demonstrates the power of Perl regular expressions. It does not
    require any non-core module. It requires Perl 5.10 at the minimum
    because it utilizes regex features like named capture and recursive
    pattern.

SEE ALSO
    JSON, JSON::PP, JSON::XS, JSON::Tiny.
